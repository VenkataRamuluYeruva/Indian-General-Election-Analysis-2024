# Indian General Election Analysis 2024

## Project Overview

This project is dedicated to analyzing the 2024 India General Election results. The data is processed using SQL to extract insights, and the analysis covers various dimensions, such as party-wise performance, state-wise breakdown, candidate details, and seat distributions. The insights obtained from the analysis will help in understanding the overall election dynamics, including which alliances and parties performed best, where key constituencies saw the largest victories, and the breakdown of votes across EVMs and postal ballots.

## Objectives

* **Total Seats Analysis**: Understanding the total number of seats contested in each state.
* **Party-Wise Performance**: Identifying which parties and alliances (NDA, I.N.D.I.A., and others) won the most seats.
* **State-Wise Breakdown**: Analyzing results on a state level to see which parties dominated specific regions.
* **Margin of Victory**: Comparing winning margins in key constituencies to identify closely contested elections.
* **EVM vs. Postal Vote Breakdown**: Understanding the distribution of votes between electronic voting machines (EVMs) and postal ballots.
* **Candidate Performance**: Analyzing the performance of individual candidates, including top vote-getters and runner-ups.

## Insights
By running this analysis, we aim to provide the following insights:

1. **Seat Distribution**: A clear view of how many seats were won by different parties and alliances across India.
2. **Party Alliances**: The overall performance of key alliances like NDA and I.N.D.I.A. across the country, helping us gauge the political landscape.
3. **Constituency-Level Insights**: Identifying constituencies with the highest margins of victory, and the top-performing candidates in each state.
4. **Vote Type Analysis**: How the votes were distributed between EVMs and postal ballots, providing a deeper understanding of voting patterns.
5. **State-Specific Trends**: Breaking down results by state, highlighting local political trends and regional party influence.

## Data
The project uses the following datasets:

* **Constituency-wise Results**: Contains information about the winning candidates, total votes, and margin of victory for each parliamentary constituency.
* **Party-wise Results**: Details the number of seats won by each party, including major alliances such as NDA and I.N.D.I.A.
* **State-wise Results**: Contains the results aggregated by states, allowing for a regional analysis of seat distribution and party performance.
* **EVM and Postal Votes**: Information on the distribution of votes across electronic voting machines and postal ballots, providing insights into voting behavior.

## Key Features
1. **Alliance-Wise Results**: Analyze how alliances such as NDA and I.N.D.I.A. performed on a national and state level.
2. **Winning and Runner-up Candidates**: Identify the winners and runner-ups for each constituency, providing insight into closely contested races.
3. **Vote Breakdown**: Examine the total number of EVM and postal votes received by each candidate.
4. **Constituency-Level Analysis**: Focus on specific constituencies to assess individual candidate performance, margins of victory, and vote types.

## Conclusion
This project will give a comprehensive understanding of the 2024 Indian General Election results, focusing on key metrics such as party and alliance performance, voter behavior, and state-wise distribution of seats. Through this analysis, we aim to gain deeper insights into the election trends and political landscape of India.
