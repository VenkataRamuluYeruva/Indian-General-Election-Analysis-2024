# Indian-General-Election-Analysis-2024

## Project Overview

This project is dedicated to analyzing the 2024 India General Election results. The data is processed using SQL to extract insights, and the analysis covers various dimensions, such as party-wise performance, state-wise breakdown, candidate details, and seat distributions. The insights obtained from the analysis will help in understanding the overall election dynamics, including which alliances and parties performed best, where key constituencies saw the largest victories, and the breakdown of votes across EVMs and postal ballots.

## Objectives
**Total Seats Analysis**: Understanding the total number of seats contested in each state.
**Party-Wise Performance**: Identifying which parties and alliances (NDA, I.N.D.I.A., and others) won the most seats.
**State-Wise Breakdown**: Analyzing results on a state level to see which parties dominated specific regions.
**Margin of Victory**: Comparing winning margins in key constituencies to identify closely contested elections.
**EVM vs. Postal Vote Breakdown**: Understanding the distribution of votes between electronic voting machines (EVMs) and postal ballots.
**Candidate Performance**: Analyzing the performance of individual candidates, including top vote-getters and runner-ups.
